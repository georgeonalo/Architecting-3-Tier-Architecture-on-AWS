In this project we will create a 3 tier architecture. It sounds intimidating but I will walk you through it step by step. The first tier of our architecture is a Web tier. It will consist of 2 public subnets in separate Availability zones, and an auto scaling group of EC2 instances launching a webpage with access to the internet. The second tier is an Application tier. This tier will consist of 2 private subnets, an ASG with EC2 instances that have inbound access from the web tier. The third tier is a Database tier. This tier will have an RDS database in 2 private subnets with inbound access from the application tier above it. So letâ€™s get to it!
#### Prerequisites
AWS account
Access to command line, I will be using Windows powershell
####### Step 1
First I will create a VPC. To do this navigate to VPC > Your VPCs > Create VPC. Now here we have a really fun tool where we can create a VPC with subnets and everything else we will need to create the bones of our 3 tier architecture. Click on VPC, subnets, etc. Then you can name your VPC and have it auto generate name tags for all of the resources associated with it.
